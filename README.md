My completed projects from Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## Capstone: Predicting customer churn
Directory: [capstone](capstone)

Predicting churning customers in the telco industry from customer demographic, financial, and usage data.
* Data quality analysis
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data cleaning / data transformation
* Model building and model selection
* Model performance evaluation 

## Deep Learning
Directory: [dog_project](dog_project)

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
* Deep learning
* Convolutional neural nets
* Transfer learning
* Keras / tensorflow

## Reinforcement Learning
Repository: https://github.com/manuelseeger/RL-Quadcopter-2

Teach a quadcopter how to fly with reinforcement learning. Includes implementations of DDPG agents for the quadcopter environment and the mountaincar-continuous environment.   
* Deep reinforcement learning
* Actor-critic methods
* Deep Q-learning, DDPG
* Experiment design and management

## Unsupervised learning
Directory: [customer_segments](customer_segments)

Customer segmentation based on buying behavior. Segment customers into clusters based on their purchases.
* Data transformation, outlier removal 
* Clustering: KNN, Gaussian mixture models
* Principal component analysis

## Supervised learning
Directory: [finding_donors](finding_donors)

* Data quality analysis
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data cleaning / data transformation
* Model building and model selection
* Model performance evaluation
